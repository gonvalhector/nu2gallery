# nu2gallery

## Introduction

**nu2gallery** is a Python tool that writes a new *Markdown* file with metadata necessary to display an image post for [gonvalhector.github.io](https://github.com/gonvalhector/gonvalhector.github.io).  
The [site](https://www.gonvalhector.com) utilizes [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as its *Static Site Generator*, which uses MD files with [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) for its posts. Image posts, as I implemented them for the gallery, contain many variables in its *front matter* that are then used by a template to display them as HTML pages.  
There was a lot of time-consuming copy-pastying used in the first few image posts I made for the site, so I ended up writing a little Python program that would agilize that process.  
That program became outdated and hard to update when newer features were implemented for the image posts, so writing a similar tool that could be easily updated, mantained and expanded upon turned into a priority. This became **nu2gallery**.
